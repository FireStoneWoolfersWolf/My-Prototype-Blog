Walmart, Costco and Trader Joe’s said those who are fully vaccinated can go maskless inside stores.Trader Joe’s stated that it will not require proof of vaccination “as we trust our customers to follow CDC guidelines.”Other retailers such as CVS, Walgreens, Starbucks, Home Depot and Target said they are still evaluating whether they would lift their mask mandates. A spokesperson for Target said: “Target will continue to require all of our coronavirus safety measures in all stores, including masks and social distancing, while we review guidance from the CDC and evaluate the guidance we offer our team and guests.”</p>

<h4>COVID-19 vaccines</h4> <img src="https://www.internationaldisabilityalliance.org/sites/default/files/custom/covid-19-vaccine.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12" > <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >Equitable access to safe and effective vaccines is critical to ending the COVID-19 pandemic, so it is hugely encouraging to see so many vaccines proving and going into development. WHO is working tirelessly with partners to develop, manufacture and deploy safe and effective vaccines. 

Safe and effective vaccines are a game-changing tool: but for the foreseeable future we must continue wearing masks, cleaning our hands, ensuring good ventilation indoors, physically distancing and avoiding crowds.Being vaccinated does not mean that we can throw caution to the wind and put ourselves and others at risk, particularly because research is still ongoing into how much vaccines protect not only against disease but also against infection and transmission.See WHO’s landscape of COVID-19 vaccine candidates for the latest information on vaccines in clinical and pre-clinical development, generally updated twice a week. WHO’s COVID-19 dashboard, updated daily, also features the number of vaccine doses administered globally.But it’s not vaccines that will stop the pandemic, it’s vaccination. We must ensure fair and equitable access to vaccines, and ensure every country receives them and can roll them out to protect their people, starting with the most vulnerable.</p>

He is sure his new teacher, Mrs. Baker, hates his guts. Holling's domineering father is obsessed with his business image and disregards his family. Throughout the school year, Holling strives to get a handle on the Shakespeare plays Mrs. Baker assigns him to read on his own time, and to figure out the enigmatic Mrs. Baker. As the Vietnam War turns lives upside down, Holling comes to admire and respect both Shakespeare and Mrs. Baker, who have more to offer him than he imagined. And when his family is on the verge of coming apart, he also discovers his loyalty to his sister, and his ability to stand up to his father when it matters most.<br> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wednesday-Wars-Gary-D-Schmidt/dp/054723760X/ref=sr_1_23?crid=11NYDLUQ2YSGU&dchild=1&keywords=true+story+books+based+on+real+life+for+kids&qid=1621249963&sprefix=True+Story+Books+Based+On+Real+Life+for+%2Caps%2C458&sr=8-23" target="_blank">Best Buy Link</b></a> </p>
